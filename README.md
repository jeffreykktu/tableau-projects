The Tableau dashboard workflow diagram outlines a structured process for creating impactful dashboards using Tableau. This process is divided into four main stages: Analyze User Requirements, Prepare Data Source, Build Charts, and Build Dashboards. Each stage is broken down into further substeps, providing a clear path to transform raw data into actionable visual insights.

## Steps
### 1. Analyze User Requirements

- Choose the Right Charts: Evaluate the data and select chart types that best convey the insights.
- Draw Mockups: Sketch initial designs to visualize how the dashboard will look.
- Choose Colors: Select a color scheme that is visually appealing and enhances readability.

### 2. Prepare Data Source

- Connect Data: Establish a connection to the data source.
- Create Data Model: Define relationships between different data tables.
- Rename Fields & Tables: Assign meaningful names to data fields and tables for clarity.
- Check Data Types: Ensure that the data types are correctly assigned for accurate analysis.
- Understand Data: Gain a comprehensive understanding of the data to identify patterns and trends.

### 3. Build Charts
- Create Calculated Fields & Test: Develop and test calculated fields for custom insights.
- Build Charts: Use the prepared data to construct charts.
- Format: Apply visual formatting to improve chart readability, including:
  - Remove Lines & Grids: Eliminate unnecessary gridlines to reduce visual clutter.
  - Clean up Axis & Headers: Simplify axis labels and headers.
  - Coloring: Apply color schemes to enhance visual appeal.
  - Tooltips: Configure tooltips to provide additional context.

### 4. Build Dashboards
- Draw Mockup for Container: Design a blueprint for the dashboard layout.
- Create Container Structure: Set up containers to organize and align dashboard elements.
- Put All Charts Together: Arrange all the charts within the dashboard.
- Format: Customize the dashboard's appearance, focusing on:
  - Distribute Object Evenly: Space objects evenly for a balanced look.
  - Format Colors, Size, Etc.: Adjust color, size, and other visual aspects.
  - Fit "Entire View": Ensure the dashboard is fully viewable within its container.
  - Add Legends: Incorporate legends to explain chart elements.
  - Add Spaces (Inner / Outer Padding): Add padding to separate elements visually.
- Add Filters & Dynamics: Include filters and interactive elements to make the dashboard dynamic.
- Add Icons: Use icons to guide users and highlight key information.
